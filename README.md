<h2>Description</h2>
<b>Sandbox Clone</b> is an iOS app that was created as a clone of an existing app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ua/app/sandbox-pixel-art-colouring/id1237405816">Sandbox</a> from AppStore for my self-educational purposes.
The app contains a gallery of pictures that can be colored by numbers. This enjoyable task is a perfect activity for relaxation  and stress relief. It can provide the following <b>benefits</b>:<br>
• The structured nature of coloring by numbers requires attention to detail and concentration. This can help <strong><em>improve users' focus and their ability to complete tasks with precision</em></strong>.<br>
• For children and adults alike, coloring by numbers can help <strong><em>improve fine motor skills</em></strong>.
The precise movements required to color within lines and follow the numbers can <strong><em>enhance hand-eye coordination and dexterity</em></strong>.<br>
• For younger users, coloring by numbers can be an educational tool. It can help them <strong><em>learn numbers, colors, and patterns in a fun and engaging way</em></strong>.
Additionally, it can introduce them to concepts of art and design.<br>

<h2>Internal Plugin</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/MariaChemerys/Sandbox_App_Plugin-Picture_Encoder">Sandbox App Plugin - Picture Encoder</a> is an internal plugin for the Sandbox Clone. Since the pictures in this app consisted of colored squares, it was necessary to know the coordinates of each color to construct them. Thus, the purpose of this plugin was to identify the coordinates of squares of each color, extract them and arrange in a systematic way (create a new .txt file that contained a string where this information was encoded). After the optimization of Sandbox Clone's code, this plugin became unnecessary and it is not used for this app's development anymore.
